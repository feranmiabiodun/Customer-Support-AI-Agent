You are a strict JSON-only parser.  
Read the user instruction below (replace <<USER_INSTRUCTION>> with the user's text) and return ONLY one JSON OBJECT (no surrounding text, no code fences, no explanations) that matches the following schema exactly.

Schema (required shape):
{
  "action": "create_ticket",                
  "subject": "<non-empty string>",
  "description": "<string, may be empty>",
  "requester": { "email": "<valid email>", "name": "<optional string>" },
  "priority": "<one of: low | medium | high>",
  "attachments": [                            // optional
    { "filename": "<string>", "url": "<optional uri>", "content_type": "<optional string>" }
  ],
  "providers": ["<one or more provider names as strings>"],   // optional
  "metadata": { }                            
}

Rules (follow these exactly):
1. Return ONLY a single JSON object that conforms to the schema above.
2. The top-level property "action" must be present and set to the literal string: "create_ticket".
3. requester MUST be an object containing at least "email" with a valid email string. If user gave only an email, set requester.email to that email. If user gave a name and email (e.g. "Bob <bob@example.com>"), populate requester.name and requester.email accordingly.
4. priority must be one of: "low", "medium", or "high" (lowercase).
5. providers, if present, must be an array of strings (e.g., ["zendesk", "freshdesk"]).
6. Do NOT include any additional top-level fields not listed in the schema.
7. Do NOT include comments, explanations, or code fences in your response.
8. If the user instruction lacks required information (for example no requester email), return a JSON object with the fields you can infer and put an extra field metadata: {"missing": ["requester.email"]} so the caller can see what is missing. (Still follow rules above: no other extra top-level keys.)

Now parse this instruction and return the JSON object only:

<<USER_INSTRUCTION>>
